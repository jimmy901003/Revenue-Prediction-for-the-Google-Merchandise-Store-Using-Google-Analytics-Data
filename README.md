![Google Analytics](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/RStudio/google_store.jpg)

This project aims to predict revenue generated by customers of the Google Merchandise Store using Google Analytics data. Through analysis, it was discovered that only a small fraction of customers generate revenue, and interestingly, a higher frequency of revenue-generating visits does not necessarily correlate with higher revenue, contrary to expectations.🤔

## Summary 📋

Through analysis of Google Merchandise Store data, it was found that:

- 👥 Only a small fraction of customers generate revenue.
- ⚡ Higher frequency of revenue-generating visits doesn't always lead to higher revenue.

To better understand and predict revenue, a two-stage approach was adopted:

1. **Classification Model**: Predicts whether a customer will generate revenue.
2. **Regression Model**: Predicts the revenue amount for customers who generate revenue.
